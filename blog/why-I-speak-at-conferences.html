            <p>I have recently counted the number of conferences listed <a href="/conferences.html">here on my
blog</a>, and I realized that I am over 50 talks! I decided to
write this post about why I have started and why I speak at conferences as
celebration.</p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>Everything started when I learned how to develop. When I left university (it was
not the best accomplishment) I began to work in one of the Lab to build a CMS in
PHP to manage their instruments. It was my first experience ever and the worst
scenario I was a solo-man in that company. Kind of a dangerous first job to me I
that’s why I call my experience a community-driven success. I wrote the
application three times:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spaghetti code until I reached the limit for the codebase.</li>
  <li>partially re-wrote it with Classes.</li>
  <li>I jumped into IRC, and I discovered the community behind Zend Framework.</li>
</ol>

<p>They helped me to figure out how to write the proper version of it. I am in love
with all this open source people that were there to help a newbie like me, and I
discovered the PHP Meetup in my city, Turin. Thank the people I met during an
event I got my second job in a proper company, with other developers and servers
in the basement!</p>

<p>To summarize, the community gave me a lot since my first day: things to learn,
new friends and mentors, and a job. It is natural to return everything I can.</p>

<p>I gave my first talk at one of the local Meetup about Vagrant in 2013. I heart
about it on some IRC channel; it was not popular in Italy yet. So the perfect
chance to give something back to all the people that helped me.</p>

<p>Today after a couple of years technologies and motivations changed, but this is
how I started. I like to be part of a community, that’s why open source is so
important to me. And I want to share what I do and to learn from other people.</p>

<h2 id="italy-is-too-small">Italy is too small</h2>

<p>The side effect about being part of an open source community is <strong>globalization</strong>.
You have teammates from everywhere, and you discover great use cases every day.
The way I look at Computer Science requires new challenges and issues to solve,
and I am not ready to take a nap solving too easy problems. This means that I
need to take risks, I changed a lot of companies, and to do that, in some way
you need to share what you are capable off, you need to put your face out there.</p>

<p>This is a rephase from a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1084968619505680387">tweet from
@rakyll</a> or at least how
I interpreted it.</p>

<p>Speaking at conferences is an excellent way to discover what other teams are
doing and to meet smart dudes that can turn out to be great mentors.</p>

<h2 id="remote-work">Remote Work</h2>

<p>Two years ago I went back from Dublin, and I decided to try remote working.  I
enjoyed it, and it is hard for me to get back at the moment.  Working at home
means that I don’t have a lot of social interaction. I am alone for about 8
hours a day, you can fix it moving to a coworking, but conferences or meetups
are a great way to get out!  <strong>You don’t need to go far away</strong>, that’s why I run a
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/CNCF-Italy/">meetup in Turin about cloud computing</a> feel
free to let me know when you jump in if you would like to speak.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I am not a developer advocate, and I don’t work in the marketing or sales team
for this reason you need to have support from your company. This is not easy, a
lot of people think that if you have social skills and you are not similar
to a robot you are not a good coder.</p>

<p>I always had managers that helped me to keep going, and I appreciate it.  I work
in a startup and time to time is InfluxData that needs technical people at the
conferences that they sponsor, and luckily I love to speak about topics that are
related to what I do at work or to what my company does like monitoring,
observability, distributed system, and clouds, so I am always happy to go!</p>

<p>That’s it! Let me know why you speak at conferences via
<a href="https://twitter.com/gianarb">@twitter</a>, and I hope my experience will help more
people to share their experiences; you are great! I will probably follow up with
other articles about how I approach a conference or an abstract so let me know
if you would like to read it as well!</p>

<h2 id="not-really">not really!</h2>

<p>During the process or writing and digesting this post I realized how important
conferences are for me as person and how sad is that not everyone can enjoy them
as I do even if they would like to do it. There are plenty of reasons but I am
not speaking about laziness here. I am speaking about under represented people
or who can not afford to pay or it is not supported by its company.</p>

<p>Luckily there are a lot of groups that we can support to mitigate this problem
and to figure out new ways to bring more people in and to build a comfortable
and friendly environment for everyone. This is a win for everyone!

<a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com/about">WhomanWhoCode</a> accepts donations, but even
if you can not give money our you can look around when you attend a conference
in order to be nice and how to make everyone around you too feel good!</p>

<p>Best Regards,

<p>[1] if you don’t know where to start you can pick a Meetup close to your place!
They are always looking for a speaker and a smaller community can help you to
give your first talk! I usually try my new talks in a meetup too!</p>

<p>[2] Be open during interviews, if you like to speak at conference you need to
convince the new company that it is a valuable skills for them too!</p>
