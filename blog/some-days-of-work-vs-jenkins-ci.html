<p>Guys please move down your hands, I love JenkinsCI! I am not here to write a
bad post about it!
I am here to share few days of reasonings about continuous
inteagrations, Jenkins CI and all this strong topic.</p>

<h2 id="reproducible">Reproducible</h2>
<p>There are a lot of tools that you can use to run tasks,
ant, make, grunt. Use it to run section or all your build on your local
environment, this appraoch increase the value your tasks becuase you use and
test them more times.
To have a reproducible build help you to maintain splitted your flow by your
runner maybe Jenkins is perfect but the are other tools and services:
Travis-CI, CircleCI, Drone, don’t create a big dependency with your environment.</p>

<h2 id="speedy">Speedy</h2>
<p>A slow test suite is a bad idea, in 1 minutes I can maintain the
focus on the execution but 5 minutes are a lot, you can take a coffé or
start to think about another task and return on your old task require an
effort. This several focus switch it’s not good, and at the same time you
lost 5 minutes for each build and for every engineer after 1 week are a lot
of money.</p>

<h2 id="versionable">Versionable</h2>
<p>I lost more time about this point and I am not sure if it is a required point
or not but TravisCI for example use a yml specification file, this file doesn’t
describe only your build but it part of the story of your application, if you
include it into the VCS. Could be it a value for your pipeline?</p>

<h2 id="maintainable">Maintainable</h2>
<p>There are a lot of tools that you can choice to create the perfect pipeline ant
it’s very easy lost your focus and start to use too much tools, you must try
all but it’s your task to create the perfect sub-set of tools the point 1
(Reusability) increase the value, use tools that you can reuse during the daily
work of your team to increase the develop and go the flow better.
Each tools that you add seems perfect until they don’t becase a problem.</p>

<h2 id="scalable">Scalable</h2>
<p>An easy way to decrease the time for your job is split it in different little
jobs and run them in parallel, you can check the codestyle and run your test
suite in the same time for example.
Another good reason to create a scalable environment for your jobs is because
your company would grow and the continuous integration system burns to helps it
to grow and not to stop it.</p>

<h2 id="unique">Unique</h2>
<p>Jenkins, vagrant, ant, make, drone, docker are only a list of amazing tools to
create the perfect pipeline to deploy and test your code but they are only a
means the goal is indeed the best pipeline for your code and for your team.
Observe how your team works, which the requirments and criticalities and design
the best pipeline for your use case.</p>

<h2 id="communication-layer">Communication layer</h2>
<p>One goal for your team is understand the status of the build without logged in
any application, because enter into the Jenkins site (at first because it is
not beautiful :P ) and it is another step to do other: create feature branch,
submit pull request, write code lalala..
Use directly the pull request to create a connection with your job, you
continuous integration system can submit a new comment or if you are working
with GitHub you can use the status check, in this way you can help your
colleagues during them work and remove a jump.</p>

<p>With JenkinsCi you can do all but if you lost more time to create your best
pipeline? Maybe you don’t know it or maybe it is not the best tool for your use
case. Jenkins is flexible, but the flexibility is only the number of plugins
that you can install?</p>

<p>I don’t know I use it but I am happy to experiment and there are a lot of new
technologies and tools that maybe can help us to do a good work, with or
without JenkinsCI.</p>

<h2 id="as-a-microservices">As a microservices</h2>

<p><img src="/img/pipeline.svg" alt="Continuous Integration and Deploy pipeline" /></p>

<p>This is a summary of a pipeline, each pipeline follows this steps and from this
point of view seems very easy!
Jenkins, drone as very stong solution but they are all in one, if you follow
this image it’s clear that maybe to create the own pipeline for your projects
play with the LEGO to mount the best steps for your team and for your project
it’s possible.</p>

<p>I am happy to share some projects to implement this approach.</p>

<h2 id="slimmer-proof-of-concept">Slimmer, proof of concept</h2>
<p>I tried to create a runner for my test suite, <a href="https://github.com/gianarb/slimmer">slimmer</a>,
to implement this thought with docker and go.
Go offers a lot of libraries and tools to create something in a bit of time and
docker it’s perfect because it creates isolated environment and it’s very easy
to scale with Swarm.
In practice at the moment this console app exec a <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.slimmer</code> a bash script
executable flexible and versionable.
<a href="https://travis-ci.org">TravisCI</a> is powerful but the YML file is it a good way
to describe a build? It’s flexible? Maybe yes but I am curious to try a “low
level” approach, because finally all becames a series of commands.
I created also a series of agent to trigger notification quicly:
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/ircer">ircer</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/slacker">slacker</a>.  You can use them to notify the
result of your build.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">composer install
vendor/bin/phpunit
<span class="nv">RESULT</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$?</span>
curl <span class="nt">-LSs</span> https://github.com/gianarb/ircer/releases/download/0.1.0/ircer_0.1.0_linux_386 <span class="o">&gt;</span> ircer
chmod 755 ircer
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> <span class="nv">$RESULT</span> <span class="o">=</span> 0 <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    ./ircer <span class="nt">-j</span> tech-team <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"You are a great develop. Your build works"</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
    ./ircer <span class="nt">-j</span> tech-team <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"No bad but your build doesn't work"</span>
<span class="k">fi</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is an example of <code class="highlighter-rouge">build.slimmer</code> with an IRC notification, it is a PoC and
I prepared a little <a href="/slimmer-poc-slide/#/">presentation</a> to
receive some feedback and I presented it during a Dublin Go Meetup</p>

<p>I wait some feedback if you are interested about continuous integration and
continuous delivery.</p>
