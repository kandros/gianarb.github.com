            <p>This article is a write up of a talk that I will give at the
<a href="https://osmc.de">osmc</a> in Germany in November about Distributed tracing.
It is a sequence of questions I got about distributed systems and distributed
monitoring.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-i-need-distributed-tracing">Why do I need distributed tracing?</h2>
<p>It always depends, I find distributed tracing useful in a microservices
environment or more in general when there is a request that flies in a system
crossing different applications, queues or processes.
If you have a problem understanding where a request fails, you need to
<em>follow it</em> in some way and tracing does just that.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-follow-a-request">how do you follow a request?</h2>
<p>First of all, we should probably change the name <em>request</em>, it looks too HTTP
oriented, and it is not really what we look for now. In modern application, you
are interested in <em>events</em>.  You need to monitor an event:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user registration</li>
  <li>payment</li>
  <li>a bank transaction</li>
  <li>send an email</li>
  <li>generate an invoice</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all events, and probably in your system, they are distributed not via
HTTP but maybe they go in a queue, or they are broadcasted using Kafka or Redis.
Distributed tracing is all about tracking events. The way to go is to create an
id. Usually, it is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">request_id</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">trace_id</code> and you need a way to
propagate it in your system.</p>

<p>For example, in a queue, you can put the <code class="highlighter-rouge">trace_id</code> as part of the payload. Via
HTTP or gRPC you can use Headers.</p>

<p>Your application can take that id, and it can create the span to trace a
particular section.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-trace-looks-like">how a trace looks like?</h2>

<p><img src="/img/trace.jpg" alt="How I image a trace for a distributed tracing app" class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>In my mind, this is a picture for one trace. Every segment is a span.
So, every span has a trace id, and every span has its own <code class="highlighter-rouge">span_id</code>.
You can attach information to every span as key value store. Let’s suppose a
span represent a query in mysql you can put the query as metadata in the span
itslef. In this way you will have a bit more context.</p>

<h2 id="do-we-need-a-standard-for-tracing">do we need a standard for tracing?</h2>

<p>I can’t convince you that interoperability is essential if you already analyzed
the problem and you answered “No” to yourself.
To build a trace you need to agree on something over languages and
applications.
That’s why I think a standard is something you can not avoid, at the end you
will end up having one just for your company.</p>

<h2 id="how-a-tracing-infrastructure-looks">how a tracing infrastructure looks?</h2>

<p><img src="/img/tracing_infra.png" style="width:70%" alt="Sketch of tracing infrastructure." class="img-fluid" /></p>

<p>The applications that are writing traces is not important. Traces is cross
platform and languages. Usually, you
point an app to a tracer. It can be Zipkin, Jaeger or others.</p>

<p>The tracer takes all the traces, and it stores them in a storage. The databases are
usually ElasticSearch, Cassandra, InfluxDB. It depends on which tracer you are
using. They support different databases.</p>

<p>In general traces are high cardinality oriented data, and you can write a lot
of them in a short amount of time. So it is a write-intensive
application.</p>

<p>There are a couple of other pieces that you can add in your tracing
infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can add a <em>downsampler</em> to select what to store. If an API request generate
too many traces probably you are interested in storing only a % of them to
decrease pressure on your database. So you can use a simple distributed hash
algorithm on the trace_id to declare what to save or not. A <code class="highlighter-rouge">mod</code> on the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">trace_id</code> is enough for example.</li>
  <li>You can add a <em>collector</em> in front of the tracer. Zipkin support Kafka For
example. In InfluxDB we use telegraf. A collector is usually  a stateless
application, it gets all the traces from the applications. It bulks them and
sends them to the tracer. A collector decreases the pressure on the tracer
itself because usually, they work better with a bulk of data. In second if a
tracer go down or you need to update it, the collector is a layer that can
keep the traces for a little bit to give you time to restore the tracer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-did-i-pick-opentracing">why did I pick opentracing?</h2>

<p>I am an interoperability oriented developer; I think it is essential to avoid
vendor lock-in and embracing a big community like the opentracing one you get
a lot of tools and services already instrumented with this protocol.  It makes
my life easy.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-have-a-tracing-infrastructure-on-prem">can I have a tracing infrastructure on-prem?</h2>

<p>You can; there are a couple of tracers open source.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://zipkin.io/">Zipkin</a> is an open source
project in Java started by Twitter.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger">Jaeger</a> looks a lot like a porting of
it in Golang and Uber makes it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of them are open source, and they support different backends like
ElasticSaerch, Cassandra and so on.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-as-a-service-tracing-infrastructure">there are as a service tracing infrastructure?</h2>

<p>There are, NewRelic has an opentracing compatible API, or
<a href="https://lightstep.com/">Lightstep</a> for example.  A lot of cloud providers offer
a tracing service. AWS X-RAY or Google Stackdriver.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-store-traces-everywhere">can I store traces everywhere?</h2>

<p>You can, but they are a high cardinality data. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">trace_id</code> is usually the
lookup parameter for your queries. It means that it should be indexed, but it
changes for every request. The consequence is a big index.
You need to keep it in mind.</p>

<h2 id="once-you-do-the-tracethen-what">Once you do the trace…then what?</h2>

<p>I left this question as the last one because I read it in the opentracing
mailing list and I think it is a hilarious question.</p>

<p>First of all, you don’t buy a pan and after the fact you start asking yourself
why you have it.</p>

<p>Probably you need to write something, and for that reason, you
buy a pen.</p>

<p>Anyway, I trace my applications because it helps me to understand my environment
over the “distribution complexity.” I can detect what is taking too long and a
trace helps me to understand what to optimize.</p>

<p>Opentracing has a set of standard annotation very useful to detect network
latency between services. You can mark a span as “client send” request for
example. And when the server gets the request, you can mark another span as
“server received.” This two information is useful to know how much time your
request spends going from client to the server and you can optimize them time
usually working on the proximity between these two applications.</p>

<p>More in general you can parse a trace to get what ever you need as normal logs
or events the powerful things is downsampling and analysis.
If you are tracing a queue system you can get the average time for a worker to
process a message.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
