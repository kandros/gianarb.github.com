            <p>I am Gianluca, I am 24 years old and I work as Software Engineer.</p>

<p>I like my work because there are really a lot of different kinds of Software
Engineer, mainly because you can work in pretty much every environment like
technology, food, cook, sport, fashion.</p>

<p>Also because there are a lot of stuff to do, if you like to work on a product,
you build features to make happy other people to buy a car or to read a news on
a online news paper.</p>

<p>If you like play with cables, racks, switchs you can work in a big or small
farm and design fancy datanceters.</p>

<p>But I like this work because a lot of people have opinions. There are opinions
built on top of big study or after a long experience but everyone is happy to
share them and use them to build a new product.</p>

<p>I am a good PHP developer, because I worked for a while with this language and
I tried to catch and verify good opinions from a lot of developers that come
from different parts of the world and from different experiences.</p>

<p>I am happy so share someone of them with you:</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nx">Opinion\One</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Good</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nv">$important</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">__contruct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$somethingThatIReallyNeed</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">important</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$somethingThatIReallyNeed</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Usually I force myself (and when I can other people :P ) to inject objects from
contructor if our object (Good) can not work without them.</p>

<p>This is a good way to be sure that your object will be completed, because you can not forgot nothing!</p>

<p>I use Zend Framework from a lot of time and I remember one class
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ServiceLocatorAwareInterface</code>.</p>

<p>I have an opion, I hate this class.</p>

<p>If you implement this interface your service has a service locator! It’s
powerfull today that you need to finish your ticket and go away with a new
feature.
After months a lot of people improve this service and they start to use a lot
of other services without think about for what reason you built your service.
Just because it’s really simple get random services from service locator.</p>

<p>Be wise, don’t allow people to write bad code and use your constructor to inject your dependencies!!</p>

<p>I have also architecture opinions like:</p>

<p>When you think about “How can I resolve this problem?” you must start from
design pattern! They are documented and tested from a lot of developers and in
more use cases.</p>

<p>Imagine your colleague that come to you around 5pm to ask how an entire
libraries is designed, you can just reply “It’s just a SOAL client, see you
tomorrow!” and you go to play basketball.</p>

<p>Or if you are building an API, OAuth2 could be a good choice for your
anthentication service. It’s tested, there are a lot of clients and
documentations.
Your clients will be good to know that you are just using
Oauth2 and nothing strange.</p>

<p>Well, I am not here to share all my opinion in a single post, all of them are
just examples of what I mean for opinion.</p>

<p>An opinion is really important! But it’s just an opinion!</p>

<p>As a Software Engineer you need to have an opinion because every day people
will try to have opinion for you: Microservices, containers, one big
repository, golang/rust.</p>

<p>To build an opinion you need to make experience and to study it’s a big effort
but to be really wise you need also to stay ready to change your
opinion.</p>

<p>In my opinion this is the main difference between smart and wise people. I
prefer the second one!</p>
