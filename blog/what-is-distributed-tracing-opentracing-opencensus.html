            <p>A few months ago I started to actively study, support and use opentracing and
more in general the distributed tracing topic.</p>

<p>In this article, I will share something about what I have learned starting from
the basic I hope to get your thoughts and questions via Twitter
<a href="https://twitter.com/gianarb">@gianarb</a>.</p>

<p>We all know the trend for the last couple of years. Spread applications across
containers, cloud providers and split them into smallest units called services
or microservices, pets…</p>

<p>This procedure brings a lot of advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you can manage people in a better way and spread them across this small units.</li>
  <li>small units are easy to understand for new people or after a couple of months.
In a work like our where there is a high turnover having the ability to
rewrite a service if nobody knows it in a couple of days it’s great.</li>
  <li>You can monitor these units in a better way and if you detect scalability
problems or bottleneck you can stay focused on the specific problem without
having other functions around. It enforces the single responsibility in some
way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Btw there are other points for sure, but the last one is very important and I
think it helps us to understand why tracing is so important now.</p>

<p>We discover that monitor this pets is very hard and it’s different compared to
the previous situation. A lot of teams discovered this complexity moving forward
with services making noise in production.</p>

<p>Our focus is not on the virtual machine, on the hostname or the even on the
container. I don’t care about the status of the server. I care about the status
of the service and even deeper I care about the status of a single event in my
system. This is also one of the reasons why tools like Kafka are so powerful and
popular. Reply a section of your history and collect events like user
registration, new invoice, new attendees register at your event, new flight
booked or new article published are the most interesting part here.</p>

<p>Servers, containers should be replaceable things and they shouldn’t be a
problem. The core here is the event. And you need to be 100% sure about having
it in someplace.</p>

<p>Same for monitoring, if the servers, containers are not important but events are
you should monitor the event and not the server.</p>

<p>Oh, don’t forget about distribution. It makes everything worst and more
complicated my dear. Events move faster than everything else. They are across
services, containers, data centers.</p>

<p>Where is the event? Where it failed. How a spike for particular events behave on
your system? If you have too many new registrations are you still able to serve
your applications?</p>

<p>In a big distributed environments what a particular service is calling? Or is it
used? Maybe nobody is using it anymore. These questions need to have an answer.</p>

<p>Distributed tracing is one of the ways. It doesn’t solve all the problems but it
provides a new point of view.</p>

<p>In practice speaking in HTTP terms tracings translate on following a specific
request from its start (mobile app, web app, cronjobs, other apps) so it’s the .</p>

<p>Registering how many applications it crosses to, for how long. Labeling these
metrics you can event understand latency between services.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hawkular.org/img/blog/2017/2017-04-19-jaeger-trace.png" class="img-fluid" />
<small>from https://www.hawkular.org/</small></p>

<p>Speaking in the right language, this image describes a trace. It’s an HTTP to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">fronted</code> service. It’s a GET request on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/dispatch</code> route. You can see how
far you can go. A trace is a collection of spans.</p>

<p>Every span has it’s own id and an optional parent id to create the hierarchy.
Spans support what is called Span Tags. It is a key-value store where the key is
always a string and some of them are “reserved” to describe specific behaviors.
You can look at them <a href="https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/semantic_conventions.md#standard-span-tags-and-log-fields">inside the specification
itselt</a>.
Usually, UI is using this standard tag to build a nice visualization. For
example if a span contains the tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">error</code> a lot of tracers colored it red.</p>

<p>I suggest you read at the standard tags because it will give you the idea about
how descriptive a span can be.</p>

<p>The architecture looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   +-------------+  +---------+  +----------+  +------------+

<p><small>from <a href="https://opentracing.io/documentation/pages/instrumentation/common-use-cases.html" target="_blank">opentracing.org</a><small></small></small></p>

<p>There are different instrumentation libraries across multiple languages and you
need to embed one of them in your application. It usually provides a global
variable where you can add spans too. Time by time they are stored in the
tracer that you select. If you are using Zipkin as tracer you can select
different backends like ElasticSearch and Cassandra.
Tracers provides API and UI to store and visualize traces.</p>

<p>As you can see from the graph above Opentracing “is able” to push to Tracers,
Logging system, metrics and so on. With my experience with opentracing, I don’t
know how this can be done.</p>

<p>I always used it with a Tracer like Zipkin or Jaeger to store spans. Logs are
covered by the spec because you can attach to every spans one or multiple <code class="highlighter-rouge">Span
Logs</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>each of which is itself a key:value map paired with a timestamp. The keys must
be strings, though the values may be of any type. Not all OpenTracing
implementations must support every value type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><small>from <a href="https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/specification.md" target="_blank">opentracing.org</a><small></small></small></p>

<p>The idea behind this feature is clear. There are too many buzzwords: metrics,
logs, events, time series and now traces.</p>

<p>It’s easy to end up with more
instrumentation libraries that business code. That’s probably why opentracing
cover this uses case. Logs and traces are time series. That’s probably why
metrics are there.</p>

<p>Using the go-sdk it looks like this:</p>
<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">span</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">ctx</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">opentracing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StartSpanFromContext</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ctx</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"operation_name"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="k">defer</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="n">span</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Finish</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="x">
    </span><span class="n">span</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">LogFields</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="x">
        </span><span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"event"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"soft error"</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="x">
        </span><span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"type"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="s">"cache timeout"</span><span class="p">),</span><span class="x">
        </span><span class="n">log</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Int</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"waited.millis"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="x"> </span><span class="m">1500</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="x">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>But I am not able to find a way to say: “Forward all these logs to ….elastic
and this traces to Zipkin”. And I don’t know if the expectation is to have
tracers smart enough to do that. But from my experience trying to extend Zipkin,
this looks like a hard idea. At first, because the tracers are out of the
OpenTracing’s scope.</p>

<p>If the goal is to wrap together everything logs have precise use case from ages.
They work pretty well and you can’t change the expectation. They can be a
real-time stream on stdout, stderr and/or other thousands of exporter. I can’t
find this kind of work there. So, looking at the code it’s not clear who is in
charge of what. But the graph is pretty.</p>

<p>I like the idea and I started looking at <a href="https://opencensus.io/">OpenCensus</a> a
library open sourced by Google from its experience with StackDriver and the
Google’s scale. It has its
<a href="https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-specs">specification</a> and
it provides a set of <a href="https://github.com/census-instrumentation/">libraries</a>
that you can add to your application to get what they call stats, traces out
from your app.  Stat stays for metrics, events. It’s another buzz probably!</p>

<p>The concept looks similar to OpenTracing, obviously, the specs are different.</p>

<p>Looking at the code, the go-SDK looks a lot more clear. I can clearly see stats
and tracing objects, they both accept exporters and they can be Prometheus,
Zipkin, Jaeger, StackDriver and so on. I like the idea that the exporter is part
of the project, you don’t need a tracing application like Zipkin, you can write
your exporter to store data in your custom database and you are ready to go.</p>

<p>You can probably do the same with OpenTracing writing your tracer that store
things in your custom databases jumping Zipkin and Jaeger, it looks a bit more
complicated looking at the interface:</p>

<div class="language-go highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">// opencensus-go/trace/export.go</span><span class="x">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// opentracing tracer

type Tracer interface {
	// Create, start, and return a new Span with the given `operationName` and
	// incorporate the given StartSpanOption `opts`. (Note that `opts` borrows

<p>OpenTracing doesn’t care about exporter and tracers, something else handle that
complexity, (the user, me.. bored) the standard only offers interfaces. I don’t
know if this is good. It really looks a lot more like a common interface
between traces. I like the idea, but I need a lot more.</p>

<p>Now, writing this article I understood that I have a lot more to figure out
about this projects, sadly I realized that in practice they are even more
similar compared my feeling before writing all this down.</p>

<p>Tracing, metrics and instrumentation libraries remain crucial from my point of
view. You can write everything you want but if you are not able to understand
what’s happening you are not making a good job. You look like a monkey.</p>

<p>Personal I would like to find a common and good library to wrap together all
the buzzwords stats, spans, traces, metrics, time series, logs because they are
all the same concept just from a different point of view.</p>

<p>Everything is a point in time, grouped, ordered or with a specific hierarchy.
You can use them as aggregate, to compare, to alert and so on. A powerful
implementation should be able to combine both needs an easy ingestion with a
clear output.</p>

<p>I think that OpenTracing has a lot to do from both sides in and out. OpenCensus
looks good from an ingestion point of view. Nothing about logs in OpenCensus
maybe because they are good enough as they are but we need to be able to cross
reference logs, traces, metrics from infrastructure and application events from
dashboards and automatic tools.</p>

<p>It looks like, with both setup, that you still need a platform capable to serve
and use this data. A lot of people will answer that it’s out of scope for
these projects, but I am pretty sure we all learned that just storing events is
not enough.</p>
